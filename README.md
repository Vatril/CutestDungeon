# CutestDungeon

This is a game I made for my job trainig some time ago.
I am uploading it to GitHub just for archiving purposes.

## This contains very bad code
It was written with aa strict deadline during my job training finals and it was my first larger C# project.
So don't take this as an example.
Just uploading it, because I dont want to loose it, and its funny to laugh at my bad code.

And yes, there is a lot of that in here

# The playable game is in the game folder
there is a complied Windows, Mac and Linux version
